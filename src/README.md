# Project 3 - LCD and Sounds and LEDs

## How it Works

### Button 1
Fur Elise will play and an empty square will be rendered on the LCD

### Button 2
In the Hill of The Mountain King will play and an empty square with a white
box will be rendered on the LCD

### Button 3
You're gonna get Rickroll'd!
The same shape as Button 2 will show up but with a red square in the middle

### Button 4
You'll see text on which button does what but for some reason, it looks kinda
weird and nasty. Forgive me
