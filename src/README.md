## How it Works

### Button 1
Fur Elise will play and an empty square will be rendered on the LCD flashing
red and white

### Button 2
In the Hill of The Mountain King will play and an empty square with a white
box will be rendered on the LCD while flashing orange, red, and white

### Button 3
*You're gonna get Rickroll'd!*
The same shape as Button 2 will show up but with a red square in the middle.

### Button 4
The sounds will stop and you will be given some text that looks like chat on
*Among Us*. Also, a link on how to quickly gain
bitcoin will be shown which you can also view [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)!
